# House-Pricing-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression
This model consists of a California House Pricing dataset consisting of over 20,000 rows. <br>
I've used 2 regression models on this one i.e. Random Forest and Linear Regressor. <br>
Also used Pandas and NumPy for Data Dreprocessing and Matplotlib and Seaborn for Data Visualization <br>
In this model you will see how to build a ML model from scratch with code readability and easy to understand <br>
