# House-Pricing-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression
This model consists of a California House Pricing dataset consisting of over 20,000 rows.
I've used 2 regression models on this one i.e. Random Forest and Linear Regressor
Also used Pandas and NumPy for Data Dreprocessing and Matplotlib and Seaborn for Data Visualization
In this model you will see how to build a ML model from scratch with code readability and easy to understand
